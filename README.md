# NLP-on-Mobile-Application-Review-Data
Using NLTK library in Python to perform text analytics on App store and Google Store user review data.

### Description
The goal of the project was to reproduce an algorithm to classify mobile application review data into few categories. The type of review provided by the users review can be categorized into bug reports (reviews which generally describe a problem that occurred using the app, such as crash or strange behaviour), feature request (reviews which
request an additional missing feature to be added to the app, perhaps a new language availability). The task of classifying and reading reviews is extremely tedious, therefore machine learning models have become very popular to accomplish this task of classifying app reviews into categories for easier utilization of informative reviews which can be beneficial to app developers
